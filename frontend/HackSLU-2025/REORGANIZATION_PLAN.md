# VoiceClarity - Codebase Reorganization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for reorganizing the VoiceClarity React Native/Expo application according to professional standards and best practices.

## Current Structure
- React Native/Expo app with React Navigation
- Screen-based architecture with minimal component separation
- Basic theming using Context API
- Minimal code reuse and organization

## Target Structure

### Directory Organization

```

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Component Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor screen components to separate UI from logic
- [ ] Extract reusable components from screens
- [ ] Group related components into feature directories
- [ ] Apply consistent naming patterns

### 2. Hook Implementation
- [ ] Create additional custom hooks for common functionality
- [ ] Refactor useTheme and other hooks for better type safety
- [ ] Create hooks for complex state management

### 3. Types and Interfaces
- [ ] Create consistent TypeScript interfaces for all components
- [ ] Define proper navigation types
- [ ] Create shared types for theme, API responses, etc.

### 4. State Management
- [ ] Evaluate and implement proper state management (Context API or other)
- [ ] Separate UI state from business logic

### 5. Styling Improvements
- [ ] Create consistent theme variables
- [ ] Extract styles into separate files
- [ ] Implement responsive design patterns

### 6. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement memoization where appropriate
- [ ] Use lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Optimize rendering cycles

## Best Practices to Follow

### Code Style
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Employ functional and declarative programming patterns
- Avoid prop drilling and excessive component nesting

### Component Structure
- Use named exports for components
- Split large components into subcomponents
- Use TypeScript interface for props

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Implement consistent error UIs

### Testing
- Add unit tests for critical components
- Ensure testability of all components

## Implementation Timeline
1. Create directory structure (completed)
2. Refactor core components
3. Implement enhanced hooks and state management
4. Apply styling improvements
5. Optimize performance
6. Add proper documentation

This plan serves as a guide for the reorganization and should be updated as the implementation progresses.
